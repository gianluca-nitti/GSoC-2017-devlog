#### Implemented read-only access to savegames and modules
At the end of the previous update, I mentioned that the next goal was to allow to work with the server *configuration* from the API/web interface. Here are some relevant points that must be taken in consideration to implement this feature:

{:.details}
- A key feature of Terasology is [modularity](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/wiki/Project-Overview#primary-repositories), so the web interface should allow server administrators to add/remove or enable/disable the gameplay modules.
- A Terasology instance can manage multiple savegames (though only one is running at a given moment), each of them with potentially different sets of modules enabled. At the moment, this is mostly used in the "client" mode, where a user can have various single-player savegames; the headless server implementation (see [StateHeadlessSetup.java](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/master/engine/src/main/java/org/terasology/engine/subsystem/headless/mode/StateHeadlessSetup.java)) creates a single savegame with a certain module list, which can be customized by editing the configuration file.
- To enable or disable modules on a certain savegame, that game must not be running. Also, usually the module list is set when the game is created and then left unchanged; I still have to investigate whether it's possible to add or remove modules on an existing savegame, it probably depends on the module.
- The permission system is internal to each savegame, i.e. a client identified by a certain client ID can have different permissions in different games and there isn't a "global" permission system.\\
\\
These considerations led me to the following conclusions:

{:.details}
- Two different resources should be added, one to manage the various savegames and their modules (I'm working on this one at the moment) and one to manage "global" server settings (such as the network port).
- A new engine state which is not running any game is required to allow the server administrator(s) to configure modules for each game. When the engine is in this state, the administrator can create one or more games in the web interface and choose one to run.
- To determine whether a client is a server administrator, a list of the client IDs allowed to perform these restricted task could be saved in a file in the server data directory.
- A command line switch can be used to tell the server if, at first startup, it should generate a game with the default modules or wait for a connection from the web interface to let the administrator manually configure the game, then start it. In a similar way, another command line argument should allow to select which game sould be started automatically if there are multiple ones.
- To allow the administrator to configure a game on the first startup, an additional authentication method needs to be added. In fact, on the first startup, there are no client identities stored in the server configuration file, because they are generated when an user connects through a normal client (not the web application). A simple solution could be to specify a password on the command line
or as an environment variable when starting the server instance for the first time, which could then be entered in the web interface.\\
\\
At the moment, I implemented read-only access to the server status and the game list with module information (both the server-side, on the new [games-resource branch](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/tree/games-resource), and the client-side, in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer-frontend)). For each module, there is a link to its [meta server](http://meta.terasology.org/modules/show) page. Here is a screenshot:

The next goal is to provide write access (creating new games, selecting modules, stopping a game and running another one), restricted to server administrators, as described above.
