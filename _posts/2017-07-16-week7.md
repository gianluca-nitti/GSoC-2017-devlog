#### Added support for various interactions with savegames
In the previous update, I described how I implemented read-only access to the server's savegame list; during this week, I added the possibility to interact with this resource. At the moment, it's possible to perform these operations from the web interface or the web API:

{:.details}
- Start and stop games - if a game is running, starting another one will automatically stop the running game, while manually stopping a game will bring the engine to an idle state until another game is started
- Add a new game, by specifying the title, seed, list of modules and world generator to use
- Delete an existing game
- Generate a backup of a game - useful before doing "dangerous" operations like adding or removing modules from an existing savegame, which will be implemented soon\\
\\
Here is a screenshot of the "New Game" dialog of the web frontend application:

As you may have noticed, the module dependencies are not resolved on the client side; in fact, for example, *Core Gameplay* depends on *Terasology Engine*, but the latter is not shown in the enabled modules list. The dependencies, at the momet, are resolved only on the server side when the user clicks OK; when the server builds the new game manifest, it adds all the necessary dependencies. A possible improvement could be to show the dependencies on the client side too, maybe together with a description for each module.\\
\\
The available modules list (the right column in the new game dialog) is obtained from the [meta server API](http://meta.terasology.org/home); however, this can't be done directly because the meta server at the moment does not support [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) so the game server is being used as a proxy (see the [AvailableModulesResource](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/blob/games-resource/src/main/java/org/terasology/web/resources/AvailableModulesResource.java) class). To improve this hack that I put together to circumvent the no-CORS problem, there are two directions I can think of: the simplest could be to send a pull request to the [meta server repository](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/meta-server) which adds a wildcard *Access-Control-Allow-Origin* header to the public API endpoints, thus making them accessible to any browser (in my understanding this shouldn't be a security problem since it's just public data); alternatively, however, *AvailableModulesResource* could be improved to not be a mere proxy but instead provide additional useful information, like the current availability of the module on the server.\\
\\
At the moment, I'm working on implementing additional features to allow modification of existing savegames, more specifically renaming them and changing the module list. Another quite important feature on the to-do list is allowing an administrator to login with a password - set when the server is started - at the first run of a server; in fact, the addition of the Idle engine state has decoupled the existence of a running server from the existence of a savegame generated with the default options. In other words, it's possible to start the server without generating the default game (using the *-dontStartDefault* command line switch) to manually configure the games using the web interface, but currently there is no way to actually access the web interface when a new server is started for the first time with that CLI argument, because the only way to login to the web interface is by using client identity certificates, which are generated when connecting to the server through a regular Terasology client - which is not possible when the server is not running any game yet.
