# Google Summer of Code 2017 project development log

This repository contains the development log website for my [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4882946033975296) with [MovingBlocks](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/).
The project is about building a web API (HTTP/WebSocket) and an appropriate web interface to interact with [Terasology](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) game servers.

The website - kindly hosted by GitHub Pages - is online at this address: https://gianluca-nitti.github.io/GSoC-2017-devlog/

## Links
- The main repository where the project is being developed is FacadeServer ([offical MovingBlocks upstream](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer) - [my fork](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer)).
- [Here](https://github.com/orgs/MovingBlocks/projects/5) you can find the project board.
