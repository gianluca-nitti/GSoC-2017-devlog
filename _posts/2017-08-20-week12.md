#### Improved mobile client user experience and implemented a more RESTful-compliant HTTP API on the server
During the first part of the last week I focused on improving the mobile user interface of the ReactXP-based client for FacadeServer. In fact, despite using a cross-platform framework, I noticed that the user interface I made during the past weeks and mainly tested on desktop browsers, was becoming hard to navigate on a mobile device, especially in portrait orientation. More specifically, the header and the menu on the left, with the navigation buttons, were taking up too much space from the main content panel. So, on the mobile version I made the header smaller and implemented a show/hide button for the navigation menu; here is a screenshot of the mobile application in the server settings tab:

\\
By touching the button on the left side of the header, the menu pops up and you can switch to the other screens such as the console, the savegame list, etc.; the login button has also been moved in the menu.\\
The web version, instead, preserves the usual look; here is a screenshot of the same tab for comparison:

\\

This is still the same application, built from the same [codebase](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer-frontend); only small layout-related sources are platform-specific, and at build time the correct ones are chosen according to the current target (web or React Native). In fact, while these changes may look very quick, some time was required to set up the different build pipelines for the two targets; to choose the correct platform-specific sources to include, the [webpack alias feature](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias) is used on the web side, and [babel-plugin-module-alias](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-alias) is used on the mobile side.\\
\\
Later in the week, I moved to the server side with some considerations in mind: the protocol abstraction layer developed in the first GSoC weeks, which allows to easily access the various server resources both via HTTP and via WebSocket works fine, however the HTTP version isn't compliant with any well-known API standard and a bit cumbersome to work with. For example, to delete over HTTP a savegame from a server running the current FacadeServer develop branch, you need to send a `POST /resources/games` request with the JSON payload `{"type": "Delete", "data": {"gameName": "name-of-savegame-to-delete"}}`, which is a shame because this resource is basically a collection of games and the supported methods map quite well to REST methods; if I had designed the server better, the action described above could be performed with a `DELETE /resources/games/name-of-savegame-to-delete` request without payload; creating a game would be a `POST /resources/games` with the name, module list and other properties in the payload; renaming a game would be a `PATCH /resources/games/name-of-savegame-to-rename` with the new name in the payload, and so on.\\
\\
So I went ahead and tried to redesign the resource management code to make the HTTP interface RESTful and at the same time keep the support for WebSocket and push notifications (i.e. the server notifies the WebSocket client when a resource changes). I'm working on the
[rest-methods](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/tree/rest-methods) branch and it's almost done (needs some minor improvements and more unit tests; I'd say it's about 85% done, and it took me about 3 days). Then, some changes on the client are needed too. Here is a diagram of the currently supported requests and some possible additions:

{:.details}
- GET /onlinePlayers -> get online player list
- POST /console -> run command specified in payload
- GET /games -> get savegame list
- GET /games/{name} -> get details about a single game
- POST /games -> create new game (properties specified in payload)
- PATCH /games/{name} -> rename game with new name specified in payload (possible addition: change modules)
- DELETE /games/{name} -> delete game
- POST /games/{name}/backup -> create a backup
- GET /engineState -> get the engine state
- PUT /engineState -> switch to state (payload contains new state, can be IDLE or LOADING, and game name if necessary)
- GET /modules/available -> get list of installed modules
- GET /modules/available/{name} -> get details about single module
- DELETE /modules/available/{name} -> uninstall specific module (currently not implemented; what about dependencies?)
- GET /modules/installer -> get module installer status message
- PUT /modules/installer -> start installing a set of modules specified as payload
- GET /worldGenerators -> get list of available world generators
- GET /config/serverPort -> get listen port
- PUT /config/serverPort -> change listen port
- GET /config/MOTD -> get MOTD
- PUT /config/MOTD -> change MOTD
- GET /serverAdmins -> get list of admins
- POST /serverAdmins/{clientId} -> add client ID to the admin list
- DELETE /serverAdmins/{clientId} -> delete client ID from admin list

The paths are relative to `/resources`; the other HTTP root endpoints to perform authentication (`/auth`) and to query events (`/events`) are left unchanged. The event system (which is currently used by the console resource only) is unchanged too; you can't `GET /resources/console` to read messages, but you need to query the global event queue at `/events`, though local event queues (e.g. `/resources/{resourceName}/events`) could be an idea for future developments.\\
\\
The same requests can be made over a WebSocket connection; a client-to-server message looks like this: `{"messageType": "RESOURCE_REQUEST", "data": {"resourcePath": ["config", "MOTD"], "method": "POST", "data": "This is a new server MOTD!"}}`, while server-to-client messages (which can be either responses to requests, or notifications that a resource has changed or emitted an event) have this structure: `{"messageType": "ACTION_RESULT", "resourcePath": ["config", "MOTD"], "data": {"status": "OK", "data": null}}` (this example is a possible response of the server to the POST request above; in case, for example, of a GET request, the inner `data` field wouldn't be null but would include the requested data).\\
\\
That said, it may be too late to include a patch of this size in the GSoC; I'll do the final changes and open the pull request as soon as the [currently open one](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/8){:.gh-pr} is reviewed (the `rest-methods` branch is based on the branch of that PR) and I'm not sure if there is time to review it before the GSoC submission deadline, given that the [diff](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/compare/admin-verification...gianluca-nitti:rest-methods) is currently 1587 lines added and 1242 lines removed. Anyway, the end user UX with the ReactXP-based client wouldn't change much; what would improve if this branch is merged is, in my opinion, the further maintainability of FacadeServer's codebase and the ease of developing alternative clients.
