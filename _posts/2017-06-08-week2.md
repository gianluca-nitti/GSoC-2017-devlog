#### Progress on client authentication via WebSocket
Since the latest update I've been working mainly on [this branch](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/compare/engine-runner...authentication).

The authentication scheme used for the web-based (or, more generically, *external*) clients is similar to the one already used to authenticate regular Terasology clients on a Terasology engine, and it's based on signing the initial handshake messages with asymmetric cryptography; the appropriate public and private keys are stored in each peer's (client or server) configuration file.

Summing up, the new code contains a [class](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/blob/75e968e235e144de3771eabff3e5240a5f4e6c24/src/main/java/org/terasology/web/authentication/AuthenticationHandshakeHandlerImpl.java) that can be used to perform an authentication handshake, like the one implemented [in the engine](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology/blob/develop/engine/src/main/java/org/terasology/network/internal/ServerHandshakeHandler.java) to handle connections from regular game clients, but not tied to a specific transfer protocol (TCP via Netty in the engine) or a data serialization format (Protobuf in the engine codebase).

This class is then used by [code which encapsulates a client-server communication based on the JSON data format](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/blob/75e968e235e144de3771eabff3e5240a5f4e6c24/src/main/java/org/terasology/web/io/JsonSession.java); at the moment, this supports the authentication handshake (delegated, with proper serialization and deserialization, to the previously presented class) and will later be extended to manage requests and notifications to allow the clients to interact with the engine once authenticated.

The final layer implements the communication protocol. At the moment, a simple [WebSocket-based interface](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer/blob/75e968e235e144de3771eabff3e5240a5f4e6c24/src/main/java/org/terasology/web/webSocket/WsHandler.java) has been set up; it (sorry if this sounds repetitive) handles, at the moment, the authentication handshake, will be improved to handle requests (in the most general sense of the term, they could be status queries as well as action requests) from clients about the running engine and to send "live" server-to-client updates.
