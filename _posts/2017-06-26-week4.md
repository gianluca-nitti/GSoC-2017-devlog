#### First frontend steps
Since the previous update I've been working with client-side code, to begin building a user-friendly frontend to the terasology server API; it lives in [this repository](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer-frontend). Unfortunately I had to slow down a bit to choose a proper framework and take familiarity with it, but I think I found a very promising solution. The framework I'm using is [ReactXP](https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp), a MIT-licensed solution from Microsoft which allows to build *truly* cross-platform applications with a single codebase; it's an additional abstraction layer built on top of Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) which allows to build a web application and native (i.e. not WebView-wrapped like in [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)) mobile applications for the major platfroms in a single shot. Moreover, it's written in and integrates well with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed language that compiles to Javascript; I already used it before and it "feels" more like Java than Javascript - has classes, interfaces, type parameters and various other features that in my opinion are useful and make the coding process less error-prone.

Here is a screenshot of the actual state of the frontend application, in the web version running in a desktop browser:

As you can see, I'm going to organize the interface in tabs which can be swithed using the menu on the left (which I should probably make a popup when the viewport is under a certain width, to avoid taking too much space on mobile devices in portrait orientation), to access different resources such as console, configuration, etc; at the moment, there are a console tab and a home tab that shows a list of the connected players. All the updates are received in real-time thanks to WebSocket. At the moment, the client connects in anonymous mode and thus is read-only (i.e. it's not possible to run console commands), and adding the code to perform authentication - by pasting the JSON client configuration or logging in to an [identity storage service](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/client-identity-cloud-storage-service.1846/) account - is my next goal. Should be quite simple since it will mostly consist in tidying up the [code I already written for testing](https://gist.github.com/gianluca-nitti/14e5d61d66d1f347330fa7f42f3db7da) and integrating it in the frontend.
