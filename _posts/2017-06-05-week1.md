#### Connect FacadeServer to the Terasology engine
Today I opened the [first pull request on FacadeServer](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/1){:.gh-pr}, the main repository where my GSoC code is going to be stored. The proposed code connects the codebase, which is actually a Jetty-based webserver, with the main Terasology engine, and runs it in *headless* (or *server*) mode (on the main thread), while, at the seme moment, it continues to listen and answer for HTTP and WebSocket connections on the threads spawned by Jetty.

A more detailed explanation of the work done is available in the pull request's description, at the link above.

The next goal is to set up the authentication protocol and code to allow the server to identify clients connecting via HTTP/WebSocket according to the game server configuration.
