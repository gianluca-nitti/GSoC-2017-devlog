#### Various small improvements to both client and server
Since the latest blog update I worked both on the server and on the client. Here is a summary of the code written during this week.
##### Server

{:.details}
- It's now possible to rename existing savegames.
- The class which provides information about available modules when creating a new game, *AvailableModulesResource*, is no longer a proxy for the [meta server](https://meta.terasology.org) but shows only the modules installed on the server and also provides information about the available world generators.
- All the server-side code described in this an the previous blog updates is on a new [pull request](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/FacadeServer/pull/4){:.gh-pr}.

##### Client

{:.details}
- There is a new screen with an animation which is shown when the client is trying to connect to the server, and if the connection fails the dialog which prompts for a server to connect to is shown again; this prevents the user to interact with carious controls before the connection is estabilished which could bring the user interface in an inconsistent state.
- It's now possible to save addresses of favorite servers in the browser or device to avoid having to type them every time.
- In the dialog to create a new game, the world generator can now be chosen from a drop-down list (you no longer need to manually type the name). Also, the module list now only shows only the modules installed on the server; a separate panel to install/uninstall modules will be added later.
- Some parts have been refactored to improve the codebase (various TODOs have been removed) and the support for Android. This required an update of the ReactXP library to it's latest version, which also introduced a small visual bug with text fields borders; I [reported it](https://github.com/Microsoft/reactxp/issues/184#issuecomment-317310770){:.gh-issue} and it should be fixed soon.
- Finally, I did some steps to allow authentication via an [identity storage service](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/client-identity-cloud-storage-service.1846/), the feature is not available yet but it required to manually build two additional ReactXP controls.

Here is a screenshot of the Android version of the client:
