#### Completed client side authentication
I'm writing this short DevBlog update to confirm that I finally managed to get the client side authentication code to work. All the relevant code is in the latest commits pushed to the [frontend repository](https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer-frontend). To achieve this goal I used the [jsrsasign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign) and [jsbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsbn) libraries to perform the RSA signature of the handshake message expected by the authentication protocol. At the moment, the public and private certificates can only be supplied by pasting the whole game client configuration file in the web interface; in the upcoming weeks I plan to add support to authentication based on [identity storage service](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/client-identity-cloud-storage-service.1846/) and maybe an option to store the certificates in the browser's localStorage to avoid having to authenticate every time the page is loaded.\\

Here is a screenshot of the authentication UI:

The working authentication code makes it possible to execute console commands; in the following screenshot, for example, the `help` command is used to obtain a list of the available commands, then the `say` command is used to send a couple of chat messages. As you can see, the text colors are supported too.

As you may have noticed from these two screenshots, the web application is now being deployed to GitHub Pages, so you can always run the latest working version (the [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/gianluca-nitti/FacadeServer-frontend) service is set to automatically deploy the working builds) by visiting [https://gianluca-nitti.github.io/FacadeServer-frontend/](https://gianluca-nitti.github.io/FacadeServer-frontend/). \\

At the moment, I'm working on adding access to server's configuration to FacadeServer and to the client.
