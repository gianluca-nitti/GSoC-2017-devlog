#### First days report
Improved and completed the [Terasology identity storage service](http://forum.terasology.org/threads/client-identity-cloud-storage-service.1846/), a sub-project I started earlier which consists of a web service to store the Terasology client identities and synchronize them across clients. This is useful if you have multiple computers, and will make the authentication for the web interface to the Terasology servers which I'll build as part of the GSoC more user-friendly.
